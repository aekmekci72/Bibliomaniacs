3/27/2019 18:09:30,7,,Hatchet,,Gary Paulsen,"6,7",,4,,,"After I read this book, I wish the conflicts Brian had faced will not happen to me too.  I wish this not because 13 year old Brian's parents have divorced and he now has to fly over from his mother’s house, to his father’s house in the north by himself.  His plane crashes onto an unfamiliar forest and he needs to learn to survive on his own.
I sometimes like to be by myself, like when I want to read, watch YouTube, or get some rest.  But I wouldn’t want to be isolated.
When he crashed, he had to overcome mental and physical conflicts.  He needed to recover from his crash landing, the feeling of being isolated, and accepting that he was unattainable from help.  However, he remained positive.  One by one, he came up with solutions to each of his problems.  He figured out where to find fresh water, edible foods, and how to protect himself from bugs and animals.  Throughout his incident, his hatchet that was a given to him from his mother still remains.  He uses the hatchet to build the key to his survival.  He creates fire, collects wood, and offers a protection to the outside predators.  The hatchet remains with him to the end even when he swam into the huge lake to retrieve the survival kit.
Brian was adapting to his environment when a tornado led Brian to be discouraged.  It destroyed his shelter and all his efforts.  But the tornado also brought Brian a chance.  The plane that had sunk to the bottom of the lake, had been brought up. Brian was given two risky choices.  He either stay safe in his shelter or risk his life to swim and retrieve the survival pack.  He decided to stay positive and choose to swim to the plane and get the pack.  When he got the pack, he activated an emergency transmitter that contacted a nearby pilot and was rescued.
Lastly, the reason why Hatchet made such an impact on me was because of how the story presents, even though unfortunate events could come your way, you will get stronger because of the hard trials and hardships.  Throughout the book, Brian grows to achieve more and more advanced challenges and later successes in overcoming all of his hardships."
4/3/2019 17:47:33,7,,The Giver,,Lois Lowry,"6,7",,3,,,"The community Jonas lives in, people can not feel emotions, see color, or have the ability to choose for themselves.  Jonas begins to realize how wrong this was when he started to train to become the next Receiver of Memory.  The Receiver of Memory’ s job, is to receive memories of the past.  He receives good and bad memories from a wise man who tells Jonas to call him the Giver.  While everybody else in the community is clueless about the past and even what is current, Jonas needs to take full responsibility of bearing the weight of all the memories.
During his training, he asks the Giver to tell him about the Receiver of Memory who failed to bear with the depression and pain of the memories.  The Giver tells Jonas the whole truthful story and Jonas realizes what would happen if he failed like the last Receiver of Memory, Rosemary had.  If he failed, all the memories he received would spread to the rest of the people in the clueless community and put them in chaos.
Jonas then asks what happens to people that are released. With horror, he understands that they without any say, get killed with a shot that gets injected into their bodies.
Jonas realizes this isn’t right and that people should be able to feel, do, see, and have the choice in what they do with their lives.  He then hatches a plan with the Giver for him to escape the community.  When I read this, I was very confused why they decided to so this.  Then I realized that if his plan did succeed, the community would get all the memories he had, making them be comprehensive of how the world used to be like and how it is now.
The plot of the Giver was great.  However, the ending of the book was very disappointing.  The author finished the book without an ending therefore making readers guess what happened next.  I think the purpose of that was so that readers would use their own imagination to finish the book.  I wish there would have been and happier ending for Jonas.  He sacrificed so much, leaving his family, friends, comfort and his security in the community.  I think he should have deserved a better ending. So for my conclusion of the book, he finds another community, is accepted and lives a long happy life."
4/10/2019 18:37:11,7,,Maze Runner,,James Dashner,7,,5,,,"My favorite scene in Maze Runner was when, Chuck, a teenager younger than Thomas, sacrifices himself from the flying knife meant to kill Thomas.  Chuck had been the one that immediately started comforting Thomas and encouraged him to be resilient when he arrived in the terrifying and unknown community.
Thomas, a teenager arrives in a glade from an elevator in the center of a great maze. Like the other dozens of male teenagers who arrived there before him, Thomas has no memories except his own name. He desperately tries to find, what is going on, but the other teenagers, had no avail.  However, the Gladers did tell him about the hideous and violent creatures that come out in the maze during the night called Grivers. Toward the end of his first day, he asks his only friend Chuck, about the Gladers whom he just watched run from the maze into the safety of the walls protecting the Glade from the maze and Grivers.  Chuck answers telling him those were Runners who run into the maze everyday to try to find  way out of the Glade.
Immediately, Thomas wants to become a Runner despite that you could die.  When I read Thomas wanted to become a Runner, I thought he was going insane.  If I were him I would be crying my eyes out for the parents I don't remember!  The very next day, the elevator provides another newcomer despite that the elevator comes only once a month.  If that wasn’t crazy enough, was that the teenager that was sent up was a girl rather than a boy.
Teresa, the girl, tells Thomas important information, the maze is a code.  The walls don’t close for the night, exposing Gladers to the Grivers. Everynight Grievers take one Glader one by one and kill them.  Thomas, not being able to wait for there cessation by the Grievers, he studies the maps, runners have kept track of for the past two years stays and resilient.  He soon figures out the code, and escapes the maze, only to find the maze was a test, and they only passed phase one, and phase two was coming.
I think the moral of Maze Runner, is resiliency.  The reason why I think this because throughout the whole story, readers see how when a conflict is thrown at him, he remains calm and finds a solution to the conflict."

5/11/2019 12:25:34,7,,Flashback (Keeper of the Lost Cities #7),,Shannon Messenger,"6,7,8,9,10,11,12",,4,,,"This book is not your stereotypical love story. It's like Star wars and Stranger Things but with more fantasy, magic, and mythical creatures. Young Sophie Foster is quite the protagonist and very different from others like Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter. Sophie is an extraordinary character because she has many magnificent abilities such as Telepathy. She's been on many adventures with hers friends, Dex, Keefe, Fitz, Biana and only a few with Linh and Tam. She's brave and will do anything to protect the people she loves.  This book is good to help kids expand their imagination and think outside of the box. In this book Sophie and her friends help the Alicorn population grow, prove that Fitz's brother is not innocent because he was part of the Neverseen, and at the end of the book Sophie Foster will go to get matched only to face a shocking surprise. This story also includes a lot of romantic stuff, it's about  trust and who you should trust.  The characters are quite unique and they all have amazing personalities. The plot is so interesting that's it's hard to put the book down! So then, I would definitely recommend this book to most kids, they should definitely read this series."
5/11/2019 15:45:48,7,,Sunny Side Up,,Jennifer L. Holm and Matthew Holm,6,,4,,,"Sunny side up is a sad, but heartfelt story. It's about a girl named Sunny who goes to Florida for an unknown reason for most of the book, but as we get closer to the end we start to find out why. While she's there she lives with her Grandfather. While her grandfather is out to get something she meets a boy named Buzz while getting soda. Buzz is a boy about Sunny's age and likes comics. He introduces Sunny to comics and they get along great. They get golf balls and then trade them for money to get comics. Sunny starts getting flashbacks to why she's actually here in Florida. Sunny's brother Dale has an alcohol addiction.  Though she is a bit sad, she didn't let her stop it from making memories. At the end of Summer Vacation, Sunny goes to the airport  to fly back to her family. Even though she feels sad she had to leave she's happy because she made a lot of great memories while she was there. This book is good because it enlightens kids about alcohol abuse and that it's a bad thing. A lot of kids who's family members have an alcohol problem can relate to this story and hopefully speak up about this problem. The characters were quite optimistic and that helped Sunny become optimistic too. The images did a good job of portraying the story. So overall this is a good book and would definitely recommend this to maybe 6th grade to any ages."
5/11/2019 19:04:36,7,,The Wright Brothers How They Invented the Airplane,,Russell Freedman,"6,7,8",,4,,,"THE WRIGHT BROTHERS How They Invented the Airplane is about the Wright Brothers when they were young and how they grew to inventing the airplane. The two brothers Wilbur and Orville Wright grew fixing their toys when they broke them. They grew up to work in their father’s bike repair shop. They eventually had an interest in aviation and started engineering planes. Out of the two brothers I like Wilbur. Wilbur is the oldest out of the two brothers and I think it would mean he has more responsibility than Orville. Wilbur was also the first out of the two brothers to test fly their airplanes. The writing style of the book is very simple. There aren’t really any hard words in the book which makes it easier to read. As a non-fiction book I think  the information was very accurate. It really explained everything in detail which is good. This book includes  pictures, which is making the book easier to read and provides the reader with these images to help the story move forward. I think the pictures did help the story move on, providing pictures of the models of their airplanes and the history of the two. Pictures make books more aesthetically appealing which is what happened here along with much more. I would recommend this book for middle school students. This book is inspiring which is good for young readers."
5/11/2019 20:10:45,7,,The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle,,Hugh Lofting,"1,2,3,4,5,6",,5,,,"The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle is a book about a boy who has a care for animals and finds one hurt in the wild. The boy brings the animal, a squirrel back to his home. He  is unable to help the squirrel and seeks for someone’s help. He meets this guy  named Doctor Dolittle and that is where their adventures begin. They go on voyages leading them to the mysterious Spidermonkey Island. Who knows what mysteries lurk on the island and the things they will do? I really like Tommy Stubbins and Doctor Dolittle. They are the main characters in the book but also the smartest ones. The writing style is very easy to read,  but there are some words that might be a little hard for some readers. There are pictures in the book which really give readers an image of what is going on in the story. Overall I really enjoyed reading the book and would recommend to 1st-6th graders. Even though that is my recommendation age it can still be enjoyed by middle school students and even adults. It’s award-winning and a great fictional and adventurous novel. The ending is a really good feature about this book. It ends with a statement that makes you want to read more. The author also illustrated the book making it more interesting."
5/12/2019 11:02:19,7,,The Hate U Give,,Angie Thomas,"6,7,8,9,10,11,12",,5,,,"The Hate U Give is a story about discrimination. It starts when the protagonist, Starr, goes to a party with her friend Kenya. Kenya ditched her though, so Starr walked around trying to find someone else to talk to. She soon found her childhood friend Khalil and they started catching up. They then heard gun shots a few minutes later, so they ran to Khalil's car and drove away. They were really happy that they could finally catch up. The happiness didn't last though, for they were soon pulled over and Khalil was shot for suspicion of having a weapon. Starr was angry and heartbroken. People rioted about this discrimination. Starr organized a lawsuit and was afraid of the police ever since. They still didn't get the justice they deserved, so Starr joined another riot and spoke the truth about why Khalil died. Starr spoke out at least 3 times after Khalil's death because she felt the need to tell people that discrimination is a serious thing and that you should never be judged because of your skin color. I recommend this book to people because discrimination is big problem and we need to enlighten people about it. The age group I would recommend this to is 6th-12th graders. The characters all had different personalities which made them unique. The story has good detail and the tension increases as the plot thickens so the book is quite hard to put down!"
5/12/2019 11:18:48,7,,Google The Company And Its Founders,,Susan E. Hamen,"4,5,6,7,8",,4,,,"GOOGLE THE COMPANY AND ITS FOUNDERS is a book about Google and how it all started. The internet has a problem, people can’t find what they are looking for on the web. The two people Sergey Brin and Larry Page have an idea. This is where Google came into mind. The decided to make a browser that would make finding things on the web more efficient. This was the start of a new time that would change the way the internet works. Out of the two, I don’t think there is a favorite. Their company was a partnership which means they both started it, owned it, and worked together on it. They are equal. The writing in this book is fairly simple and there aren’t really and hard words. This book is non-fiction, and I think the information is very accurate. This book also has pictures which I do think moves the story on. The pictures also really show what the words are describing in the book. I  would recommend this book to 4-8 graders. Even though it’s my recommendation I still think others can enjoy it. It’s very informative and you can learn a lot about the search engine millions of people use."
5/12/2019 15:09:39,7,,The Mark of the Dragonfly.,,Jaleigh Johnson,"6,7",,4,,,"The Mark of The Dragonfly has no clear lesson, but the book is quite interesting. The book is about a girl named Piper. Piper lives in a town full of hoarders or in other words, a scrap town. Piper herself is hoarder, but one day during a meteor shower everyone was waiting inside for it to be over and collect all the good scraps. Though Piper couldn't wait and went out while the storm was still going so she could get  better scraps. Piper's friend was worried about Piper so he ran after her. Though he soon got hit by a meteor. Piper took him somewhere to heal and she continued looking for scraps until she came upon a cart which people from the Merrow Kingdom used to get to the Scrap Town. Inside the cart was a girl who had the mark of the dragonfly. Piper taught the how to do regular human things and they went to the Merrow Kingdom to return her to her home. Though, Piper soon found out that Anna was no normal human being and was actually a robot! Anna went to go find the person who made her and he tried to kill her and Piper in the process. Anna and Piper finally found their way to the Merrow Kingdom's King and Anna didn't want to stay there. Anna wanted to stay with Piper. So they stayed together on a train with Piper's boyfriend, Anna, and the train crew. This book was quite interesting and I recommend it to 6th-12th graders. This book helps kids expand their imagination and be more brave. The characters are all different and each have a different aspect that makes them special. The story line was amazing, so it's hard to put the book down!"

The car though isn’t just any normal car, it’s a race car! This group is trying to engineer a race car for a race at Richmond International Raceway. They have little time to pull off a life changing experience. The group goes to the race and competes for the win. It’s a test, a test to see what women can do, and a test to prove women can also do things men can do. I can’t really decide if there is a favorite or superior character in this book. The women all work in a group to engineer a car to race and win. They are a group and work together which is something you can’t take away from them. The writing in this book was fairly simple although there are definitely some tricky words. This is a non-fiction book and the info that was given seemed correct and believable. I think I would recommend this book to middle school  students, high school students, and adults. The reason I chose middle school  students as my recommendation group is because there are some tricky words in this book which would make it hard for young readers."

Men discriminate them and say they can’t become astronauts. These women go through tests to try to become astronauts and prove they can do what men can do. They prove they can become astronauts. After lots of time taken away by training and being put through tests, the group of women become astronauts. Who knows what they will do next? Out of the thirteen of them I think Jerrie Cobb is the best one. She was the best one in the group and definitely  the more prominent out of the thirteen. She worked hard and was put through lots of trouble. Though this all happened, she proved herself worthy and earned what she had worked for. This book’s writing is pretty easy. It’s simple, easy to understand,
and there aren’t really any hard words. This book was non-fiction. I think the information is believable and it’s a true story. The book contains images which definitely help the story move on. The pictures show what is going on and what the words are talking about. I would definitely recommend this book to 4-8 graders, specifically girls. There is a reason for this. This book is about women and talks about discrimination towards women and gender equality. Although this is about women and should probably be read by girls it an amazingly inspirational story and can be enjoyed by anyone."

They end up going to a science fair and winning. Homer’s dreams come true and Coalwood is proud of Homer. Who knows what Homer will do in the future? There are four boys in the group. Out of the four I definitely think Homer is the best. He’s smart, he’s dedicated, and most definitely the leader of the group. The writing in this book if fairly simple  although there are a few words that may be tricky for younger readers. This book is non-fiction. The information that was given and the story all seem true. This book does contain images but only a few of them. These images do in fact help the story. The pictures give a visual concept of what the words are talking about and what is going on. I would recommend this book to 5-8 graders. This is because there are a few words that might make this book tricky to read for some younger readers. This book is also very inspiring and informative which is good at a young age. Even though this is my recommendation, high school students and adults can enjoy this book as well."

She is far from your average popular girl. She easily steals Leo's heart. She is popular for a while, but it doesn't last. Since a girl named Hillary is really popular she made everyone hate Stargirl. Though, not everyone turned against her. She still had   a small group of friends and Leo. Leo was dating Stargirl in secret so no one knew, until Stargirl told everyone. Leo and Stargirl became quite unpopular and everyone stopped talking to them. Stargirl won a contest and no one cared and she was still unpopular. Leo didn't like all the negative attention so he made Stargirl the only thing she wasn't. Stargirl was soon a normal girl that looked like every other girl at that school. The only thing was she was still unpopular, Leo and Stargirl spent a lot of   time together and soon Stargirl was back to being her normal self. Though, soon she disappeared without any reason. The characters were your pretty typical high school people, but the story line was great nevertheless which makes the writing style really good. This story is really relatable to high school life and I think something from this story that you can learn is that no matter if people don't like yo or not there will always be people who will. I will definitely recommend this book to people from 6th-12th grade."

Monkeys in Africa are dying of a terrible epidemic!  Who knows what else he will do there and what problems he might face? This was the beginning of new adventures, and new experiences. Doctor Dolittle is definitely the best character in the story. As the main character he goes through a lot and is experiencing everything going on in the story. The writing style in this book is very simple. There aren’t any hard words which make the book enjoyable and easy to read. This book contains images. These images are really helpful to the story. They give a very nice visual aspect of what is going on in  the book. I would recommend this book for 4-7 graders.

Though, they notice the house seems really odd. While cleaning, Emily and her little brother Navin go to a room upstairs. There Emily finds an amulet. She puts it on and goes back downstairs with Navin because their mom is calling them. Their mom hears a strange noise coming from the basement. She brings a flashlight with her and goes to see what's wrong she looks around though when she looks behind her, to her horror she screams. Emily and Navin hear this mom's scream and go to see what happened. They get there to only see her flashlight. They see a path  leading outside. They follow the path and start running to find her. The amulet starts glowing and it tells Emily to go to a certain place. They go there and they start going on the hunt for Emily and Navin's mom. The characters are pretty typical, though I  like the fact the book gives a lot of insight of the character and the characters get good development. The plot was really good, before it was really calm then the tension increased because their mom was kidnapped. The images did a great job of explaining the plot. You could see everything happening. I would recommend the book because it's quite thrilling and it's quite inspiring too. The grade levels I would recommend this to is 7th-12th."

They're been together ever since. At their school a  lot of kids use their phones in class or anywhere. They all have been through times together and they all have different personalities. Though,  one day during math class a girl named Ruby was on her phone and her teacher caught her sending a horrible message about a teacher. This caused the school to ban phones the next day to prevent any events like this from happening in the near future. The phones were to  be left at home or dropped off at the office and to be picked up after school. Most students thought this was preposterous. Though soon, the four boys found a way to communicate by posting post-it notes on each others lockers. Soon a lot of kids started doing this. At first the notes were friendly and nice and soon they had insults. Posted is a book about friendship and hardships. The characters have strong personalities that make them stand out from other characters. The story was really confusing at first but as it progressed it started to become good and I could understand it better. I would recommend it to 6th-12th graders because they can learn how words affect people."

Will they ever let Doctor Dolittle leave? Who knows what might happen to him on the moon?! The best characters in this book are the main ones. Doctor Dolittle and Polynesia are those characters. Out of the two I think Doctor Dolittle would be the best character. The writing style of this book is a little hard. There are some words that might make the book hard to understand. This book includes images which really help the progression of the story. It keeps things moving forward by giving a visual of what is going on during the progression of the story. I enjoyed reading this book and would recommend this book to 5-8 graders. There are some words that are specifically for the level of 5-8 graders. I recommend 5-8 graders to read this book because they would be able to understand this book well compared to younger readers.

Though before this, Sophie and her friends were out in the forest looking for something. Sophie spotted something so she ran after it. Once it finally stopped she'd realized she had found an alicorn. Though when Sophie finally found the leader of  the Black Swan he seemed odd and when Sophie read his mind it was blank. Alden felt guilty for this and fainted so Sophie took him back to Everglen. He was in a coma, but soon Sophie figured out how to heal him and he was all better. Can she heal a broken mind though? The characters in this book are all different in unique ways. The plot always focuses on one main point and when we are so close to finding an answer to a main question in the book it ends on a cliff hanger. This makes the book worth reading and hard to put down. I would definitely recommend the book to anyone who likes fantasy or anyone who has a struggle with fitting in because they can relate to the protagonist Sophie Foster. The grade level I would recommend this to is 6th-12th."

Though Sophie was caught off guard when the pyrokinetic suddenly formed a ring of fire around them. Everyone got out safe except Councillor Kenric. Kenric was the only councillor that always supported Sophie. Sophie was sad that he died. She used this sadness to prevent any more of the people she loved from getting hurt. Later she finds out the Black Swan was using her and her friends to draw out the Neverseen. She demands a meeting with them, but when she gets there she sees someone who she didn't expect to see. Overall, Everblaze is a bit of a sad book. The plot was quite calm, but then the tension started increasing and the plot twist happened. The characters are quite unique, because they all have different personalities. I would recommend this book to 6th-12th graders or anyone who has lost any loved one from a casualty because it helps people move on and it also helps enlighten kids about casualties.o has lost any loved one from a casualty because it helps people move on and it also helps enlighten kids about casualties."

The sadness of his experiences on the moon are being compared with his funny experiences of trying to be put in jail so he could write his book. The main characters in this book would be Doctor Dolittle and his assistant Tommy Stubbins. Out of the two I think Doctor Dolittle would be the best. He’s been going through so much on the moon while Tommy was waiting for him. The writing style in this book is pretty easy. Even though this may be true, there are still just a few tricky words in this book. Otherwise, it’s easy to read and understand. This book has images that really help the progression of the story.

The writing style in this book isn’t that  hard. There are only a few words that may be hard to understand. This book contains images. These images are very helpful to the progression of the story. They show what the story is talking about and what is going. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and all the other Doctor Dolittle books in the series. I would recommend this book to 6-8 graders. The hard words in this book made me bring the grade recommendation higher. The story starts with a slave ship which is something younger readers won’t understand which is why the age recommendation starts at 6th grade. But the lowest is 6th grade because this book is fiction. Fictional books spark imagination which makes them great to read.

But are their efforts worth the cost? Baze and Chirrut are the main characters in the book. Being the main characters give them an important role. Out of the two I think Chirrut is my favorite. He is brave and wise. What more do you need? For a fiction book the writing style in it is a little hard. They are quite a few words that may make the book hard to read and understand. This book does contain images which really help make the book less confusing with the hard words in it. I really enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it to 5-8 graders.

Callie was Katie’s best friend but would rather hang out with the new friends she made from camp. Callie is still nice, nicer then her friends, and buys a cupcake from Katie at the fund-raiser.
The writing style of this book is realistic fiction, and it uses a first person point of view. I would totally recommend this book, it is great for grades 4-8.

She must decide whether to face torture or cooperate with her captors. She chooses the latter but reveals her knowledge through a story of her friendship with Maddie, who is believed to be dead. The second part of the story is of Maddie. She tries to figure out a way to save her friend with the French resistance, and return back to Great Britain.
The book is historical fiction, and it reveals many facts and difficulties from the time period. For instance, there were very few female pilots. Also, the first part of the book is a confession and is very similar to a narrative. The second part is written in a pilot’s log by Maddie. Both describe the struggles and events going on through their writing. In the writing, stories of their life, friendship, family, fears, and many other ideas show up and enrich the story along with occasionally adding humor.
The book allows the reader to see two perspectives on the situation and hides many clues that would be hard to find reading it the first time. The book has a major plot twist at the end which reveals the result of the entire mission.
I would recommend this book, especially to readers who enjoy historical fiction. I enjoyed it because the plot had me hooked, and I wanted to know what would happen next. The details gave me a good understanding, and the characters were very well developed. The book reveals the struggles of war and allows readers to understand the hardships of the two characters. The story will make you wonder if you would be able to do the same actions and question how strong your own friendships are."

This is a quote from the award-winning book, “Wonder” by R. J. Palacio. Wonder is a book about a boy named August (but most people call him Auggie) who starts middle school. Auggie has never been to a real school before, because of a rare disease called Treacher Collins. Auggie is nervous, and he gets bullied. But Auggie, later on, finds a new friend. Jack Will. At first, Jack only hangs out with Auggie because he feels bad, but later on, finds out how cool Auggie can be, and they become best friends. Jack talks bad about Auggie behind his back, so Auggie hangs out with a girl named Summer. In the end, Auggie and Jack become best friends again.
The characters in this book are Auggie, Summer, Via, Jack Will, Auggie’s parents, Julian, and much more. Auggie is the main character in this book and his best friends are Jack Will and Summer. Jack Will is Auggie’s friend from the beginning but later talks bad about Auggie. They eventually make up and Auggie forgives him. Summer is optimistic, kind, and outgoing. She does not only hang out with Auggie because the principal told her to. She did it because she wanted to show kindness. Summer is always by Auggie’s side and always stands up for him. Via, or Violet, is Auggie’s big sister. She is caring, kind, and great at acting. Sometimes she  is jealous of the attention that Auggie’s parents give him, but at other times, she can be an understanding sister. Auggie’s parents are very protective of Auggie. They are very understanding of Auggie’s problems, and always make time for him. Jullian is obnoxious, insecure, and a bully. He makes fun of Auggie just because of his face.  He is quick to judge and does not care about other people’s feelings.
The book “Wonder” changed the world. It opened people’s eyes to how someone would feel having a facial deformity. It also taught people that you should never judge a book by its cover, and always be kind. It shows how cruel the world can be and how you should always stick together with the people you care about. “Wonder” is a great read for families, and I think everyone should read it."

She plans to pretend to be the betrothed of the crowned prince, Prince Casimir, as a way to infiltrate the castle. She will lead an ambush on the castle, and kill the king, along  with everyone he loves. But how will her plans change when she falls in love with the prince? The complexity of the characters and the character growth they experience throughout the story, make them seem like real people. The relationships between the characters are very believable as they express hate, love, and trust towards one another. In addition to this, the characters reflect on their past decisions with emotions such as regret and sadness that show very well in the writing of the book. Because of how close to human these characters are, it is easy to care about them as they are forced to make hard decisions that will change their lives. I would recommend this book because it is beautifully written, with many twists and turns, and the story’s fast-pace ensures you will never be bored. The book is filled with action that keeps you on your toes in anticipation as you wait for something big to happen."

In addition to this, the other Testing Candidates are determined to get into University, including sabotaging the other candidates. Cia must make smart decisions if she is to make it through The Testing and get into University. The characters seemed very realistic and their emotions were beautifully displayed in the book. The story was very realistic, which helped me visualize the setting and the things the characters were experiencing. However, the book started off slowly,  making it hard to get into. The story is action-filled and makes you think as you experience the adventure with them. I would recommend this book because it was so hard to put down after I started reading it. There are many plot twists that keep the book interesting and keeps you on your toes."

As they grow closer so does the time for them to say goodbye, but how can love survive the distance of an entire ocean?
The second I picked this book up I became entranced by how smoothly it is written. Every word and phrase felt significant, yet I never felt overwhelmed by all the descriptions and details.
The way the author switches perspectives between the two protagonists each chapter allows the reader to better understand the characters. While I was reading this book, I felt almost as if I were there watching each scene. The imagery truly paints a beautiful picture.
Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a novel filled with romance and adventure. It kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end, and is one of the most wonderful books I have ever read."

Percy Jackson teaches you about each god’s past, linking one story to the next, each god to each other. He shows you each of the gods’ powers, faults, and many funny stories about them.
Percy teaches you the basics of Greek mythology in a fun and engaging way. Percy’s humor and jokes make the book easy to read and laugh at. The pictures made it easy to visualize the Olympians’ power and just how frightening they were to the people from the past. The writing beautifully weaved in Percy’s personality to the classic Greek stories.
I would recommend this book because it is a fun way to learn Greek mythology. This book is also the kind of book that you could read over and over again. Every single time I reread it I could not put the book down."

Throughout this book, the reader can truly connect with the protagonist. The author does an amazing job of describing the thoughts and emotions of Lara Jean. It is as if you are looking at the story through Lara Jean’s eyes because you see the good, bad, and the in-between moments.
All in all, I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a modern-day love story. This novel sucked me in right at the beginning, with its original yet relatable plot. After all, being in a relationship, real or fake, is challenging."
3/24/2020 15:40:16,7,,Percy Jackson's Greek Heroes,,Rick Riordan,"5,6,7,8",,5,,,"Percy Jackson, the demigod son of Poseidon, introduces you to Greek’s mightiest heroes. With the classic Greek heroes: Perseus, Psyche, Phaethon, Otrera,   Daedalus, Theseus, Atalanta, Bellerophon, Cyrene, Orpheus, Hercules, and Jason, Percy Jackson teaches you the basics of each hero showing you each hero’s best moments as well as their most embarrassing stories. Percy teaches you how the Olympian gods influenced each hero’s lives in a good or bad way.

Percy Jackson once again gets us laughing with his humor and funny jokes, even when the stories are serious. The many pictures ensure you understand the dangerous situations each hero had to overcome. The book is beautifully written thanks to Rick Riordan’s ability to weave one’s personality into a classic story.
I would recommend this book since it is an easy and fun way to learn about classic Greek heroes. The book is easy to reread and get more information out of it each time you read it. This is a good book for those who know a lot about Greek Mythology and for those who don’t since you could always learn something new from this book. The book is almost impossible to put down once you start reading it and will keep you laughing at all the hilarious jokes."

The author does an amazing job of conveying the hardships and challenges that come with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Through this book, the reader can become more educated about OCD through a real-life story.
In every chapter of this memoir, there is an ongoing fight between the protagonist and herself. Every emotion the author describes is powerful. As I was reading this, I felt like I could truly understand the main character.
Through sharing her story the author has created a beautifully written book. Overall, I would definitely recommend this memoir to anyone looking for a book about the internal battle life can be."

As Olivia realizes that Em had betrayed her, their distrust towards one another becomes clear and both know that a war between their own race might be in their near future, but only will be victorious.
The characters were very realistic and as you get to know them more, you start to care about them. The feelings you develop for the characters make you feel bad for them and sometimes, scared for their lives. The dialogue was beautifully written like the characters were real people talking, and as the characters created new bonds with each other, it displayed beautifully within the writing of the book.
I would recommend this book because the writing is beautiful, and the characters are complex and human-like. However, the book was slower than the previous two, the book still keeps you at the edge of your seat as you worry about each character’s life."

Peter, who wants to make his ex-girlfriend jealous, decides to go along with the lie. But can a fake relationship inspire real love?
The writing of this book is very descriptive, and the characters are very relatable and act like normal teenagers. The personalities of the characters are interesting and lovable with faults that make them seem like real people. The relationship between the three sisters is so funny and sweet because of how close they are. They are like every sibling relationship since they love and hate each other but still help each other out.
I would recommend this book because of how interesting the story is and how lovable and sweet the characters are. Once you start reading it, you will not be able to put it down."

Lara Jean holds a 7th grade reunion and invites everyone including John. Peter invites his ex-girlfriend causing Lara Jean to be jealous while Peter is jealous of John. Could Jealousy tear the two apart?
Jenny Han captures teens perfectly in the way they act and think. Lara Jean’s emotions show strongly in the writing of the book and makes you feel them along with her.

4/5/2020 0:07:42,7,,Tell Me Three Things,,Julie Buxbaum,"6,7,8",,1,,,"Tell me three things is a young adult novel written by Julie Buxbaum. It is a mystery/romance genre centered around the life of a teenager named Jessie, still getting over the death of her mother who died from cancer. Her father eloped with a rich actress and they moved to a small wealthy town. As Jessie tries to fit in with the rich kids at her private school, and deal with bullies and boys, she also tries to piece together who is sending her text messages and emails about her new environment.
It is clear Buxbaum is trying to portray Jessie as a bullied girl who's dead mom is taking a toll on her social life, but Jessie is a very unlikeable character. She is very aggressive at parts of the book, such as saying she thinks of beating her father until he bleeds and begs for forgiveness, and thinking she wished her father died instead of her mother. Buxbaum tries to get the reader to feel sorry for her by including tough situations, but Jessie outdoes that by being aggressive and annoying.
The ending is both predictable and surprising, because you thought the person who wrote Jessie all those messages would be someone you never expected, perhaps the girl who was bullying her, or someone who was hiding from the shadows, but it is the person that was so obvious all along and provided no surprise or excitement at the end. The very ending, the person who was sending her all those messages, it was the reason people keep reading. But the person who you have been waiting throughout the entire book to find out is the bland obvious guy. The 'surprising ending' was just a deflated helium balloon slowly exhaling air. Nothing to look at but it's at least something.
This book is not a good read. Very predictable, no exciting moments, doesn't leave you thinking. Simply bland, boring, and cliche. Do not recommend reading, waste of time and waste of money. This book is a 1 out of 5 stars."
4/5/2020 0:48:06,7,,Sadie,,Courtney Summers,"7,8,9,10,11,12",,5,,,"Sadie is a young adult mystery novel written by Courtney Summers. Sadie Hunter is  a girl that went missing from her small town Cold Creek. When popular radio personality West McCray gets a call from an anonymous person begging to help find Sadie, he decides to start a radio series dedicated to finding Sadie. Sadie fled her town after her younger sister Mattie was found dead, burned in a fire. She is intent on finding Keith, the man who dated her mother and left, believing that he murdered her sister. Switching POV's back and forth between the radio series transcripts and Sadie, it is a wonderful mystery.
The switching POV's is one of the best parts of the story. You put the pieces together throughout the story, finding out clues that the characters don't realize. Hearing both sides makes you really feel like you are in the story, helping McCray find Sadie.
Summers is a very talented author who uses descriptive words and good angles to help the reader see the story from all sides and really immerses them in it.
Sadie is a very relatable character who you can understand. The book brings in things that everyday teens relate to, involving parent fights, and angsty moments.
Sadie's pain, shock, anger, and happiness really sticks to the reader, and you feel for her, every single moment. The suspense and shock and thriller really gets to you.
You can't stop reading, always wanting to see what comes next. And it is always  worth it. The twists and turns in this book are amazing. Summers could make watching paint dry an interesting read. There is never a dull moment in the characters and the plot.
The ending is surprising and shocking. At the very ripe moment when you finally figure out what is going to happen to Sadie - will she come back? Will she die? Will she be gone for good? What happens to Sadie? The best part of reading is using your imagination to think up what happens next. No spoilers should come up, but the ending is something seat gripping and sweat dripping, and will leave you satisfied for long after you finished reading.
Sadie is an amazing read that leaves you on the edge of your seat. Summers is a creative talented author that will make you feel so much. Definitely read this book."

When Harry returns to school, everyone is preoccupied with fear of Sirius Black. Soon Snape shows up and we learn the shocking truth, Sirius Black is innocent and Scabbers the rat is really Peter Pettigrew, in Animagus form, which gives him the ability to turn into an animal at will. Voldemort's servant and the real criminal. Meaning, Sirius was framed. it turns out Sirius Black is a good guy and Harry's godfather. But Pettigrew escapes and Sirius is captured by the Dementors.
Harry and Hermione use a device to turn back time, and they manage to help Sirius escape.
The main character of this book is Harry Potter. He is brave, loyal, and selfless. His best friends are Ron and Hermione, and they are always by his side. He recently discovered his godfather is Sirius Black and they form a very close relationship.
I think this is a wonderful read and Harry Potter is a great role model for kids. However, younger grades might not understand some parts of the story, as some of it is confusing. This story is a wonderful example of loyalty and forgiveness."

Bella has once again found herself in the middle of conflict and now faces a new decision between Edward and Jacob, knowing that choosing either one can make the old conflict between vampires and werewolves much worse.
The story is very interesting and fun to read. The dialogue makes the characters seem real and it is fun to see them interact. The relationships between people are very realistic. Each character is very well developed. Also, the emotions Bella experiences are displayed very well in the writing. The story is very original and the world Meyer has created expands with every book. As Bella faces tough decisions it feels like we are there with her, struggling to make a choice.
I would recommend this book because it is a good continuation of the Twilight series. The book is very engaging and the story is easy to get absorbed into that you will never want to put the book down again."

But as memories of her past come back in her nightmares, Cia must  figure out who she can really trust. However, the more digging she does, the more dangerous her path becomes. Cia must decide whether to continue on this new path or stay put to keep her friends and family safe.
The characters are very realistic, with the exception of Cia, who is unusually perfect. The characters are different from one another with different skill sets that make each of them dangerous. The writing is marvelous, and the story keeps you thinking as Cia solves each problem that is thrown her way.
I would recommend this book because of how action-packed it is. Even though the storyline is very similar to most dystopian series, the book is still beautiful. As soon as you pick it up, you won’t be able to put it down."

Cia is determined to do whatever it takes to end the testing that killed many bright minds and her friends, even if it means having to kill the people she once admired.
The story is very interesting and keeps you thinking as Cia tries to solve the problems that are thrown at her. The writing is beautiful and takes you into Cia’s world and makes you believe you are actually there.  As Cia goes through many emotions during the story, you experience them right along with her. The characters, for the most part, seem realistic and act just like regular humans. The book closes off the trilogy nicely, but it is still very sad that this is the final book of the series.
I would recommend this book because it is a very interesting story to read. The book has many twists and turns that make you worry about each character’s life. Once you start reading, it is hard to put the book down again."

One   day, his group is ordered to find a downed British Pilot. After hiding him, Michael and his parents come at night to pick him up. Meanwhile, Michael befriends Fritz, whose father is a part of a team developing a plane. Simon, the downed pilot reveals that his mission was to investigate t this plane. As Michael and Fritz bond, Michael discovers more about the plane, even using his photographic memory to memorize blueprints that Fritz shows him. Simon's escape goes all wrong, and Simon goes missing.
Additionally, Michael has to find a way to get onto a secret team to find out what they intend on doing. [spoiler] In the end, it is decided that Michael will turn in his parents and Simon, who later returned, to get onto the team. Simon is killed, but Michael is added to the secret team, and they travel to Switzerland to kill everyone attending a science meeting. Michael manages to bring the main target onto a lift going down the mountain where the meeting was held, only to be confronted by Fritz, who had a bomb and was ready to die for the Nazis. The two boys battle it out, but eventually, Fritz is swept away by an avalanche. Michael saves the scientist and escapes to Great Britain where his parents are waiting. Then he writes down all the blueprints of the plane that he memorized.
The book is based on real facts. The Germans were developing the Messerschmidt Me262, the first jet plane, and the allies needed to find out about it.
The book is written from Michael’s point of view. This allows the reader to understand the hard decisions he has to make, as well as feel his emotions. Likewise, the reader can understand how Michael sees other characters, and how he connects, especially with Simon. Throughout the book, it becomes clear how difficult life was back then, and that sacrifices had to be made, which is a major theme.
I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction or adventure. It is a great book to understand the sacrifices made during a war."

Everyone at his school knows about his mother’s illness which causes teachers to distance themselves and students to bully him. Conor is recently visited by this monster who he believes is fictional in his dreams. The monster tells him tales that show the complexity of human emotions and their brutality when it comes to admitting the truth. Conor neglects his grandma and father’s advice, glossing over his mother’s current medical conditions. The monster influences Conor’s decisions by making him destroy the relationships with his family and friends. The monster represents Conor’s inner demon, who fears losing his mother forever. This writing style was very unique, as a picture of both the monster and Conor is occasionally depicted throughout the chapters. These pictures represent the abhorrent relationship Conor faces with his monster which causes him to lash out. I would recommend this book because it explains an issue that applies to many people in society today. Whether it is a death in the family, people think it is best to avoid these issues by secluding themselves.
Conflicts will further advance and soon enough, it’ll be too late resulting in endless regret. The more Connor talks with the monster, the more the monster comes to reality. Similarly, the more we converse about our pain, the better we understand not only the situation but ourselves."

The main character June who is now 34 years old creates the Joy Luck Club, previously started by her mother. The Joy Luck Club is where the people would play mahjong and eat different Chinese traditional snacks. They all describe their relationships with their mothers and the sacrifices they had to give when growing up. They all endured many cruel conditions, trying to conform to traditional Chinese customs.a They would be ostracized from their own family for not acting the Chinese way and being more Americanized. Amy Tan depicted a clear line between being Chinese and being Chinese American.
There were different ways to show your affection and Chinese people were more two-faced. The women in the Joy Luck Club faced a tear within their identity and struggled finding any sort of acceptance in their lives. This novel touched upon many significant things in Chinese history and understanding their backgrounds. I would recommend this book because it definitely helped educate me more about my family background. The only issue of this book was that it was a bit hard to distinguish between some of the different character’s stories, but nonetheless, all their stories were extremely heartbreaking."

The Mogadorians, a cruel race that destroyed Lorien and is looking to take over Earth, are also on Earth, looking for the last nine Lorics, or Gardes, to kill. The Loric charm protects them, and as long as they don’t meet up with one another, they can’t be killed randomly. Each Garde has a number, and they can only be killed in that order. Numbers 1, 2, and 3 are already dead, and John is next.
This book has it all. It is action-packed and is very suspenseful. It also has emotion mixed into it. The emotional scenes were quite good, and I felt like I was right there in the middle of the story. The characters do feel real, and it feels as if you are there with them, fighting the hostile aliens.
However, if you’re after an action-packed book, this book is not for you. Sure, there were some action-packed parts where John was a hero, but since this is the first book in the Lorien Legacies series, this book primarily focused on character development. The book gave some background on how John was training with Henri and how he couldn’t sleep and texted Sarah. We got to know about John’s past and saw a glimpse of how difficult his life was going to be from now on.
Overall, this book is a solid 4/5. Yes, this book does have some dry spots, and it does take away from the whole book. But despite that, this book was pretty exciting, and even with a few mishaps, it was a great book and I definitely would recommend it to other people to read it."

addition to the series. The development of the main characters are very interesting.
John (Four), who is being accused of being a terrorist after the destruction of
Paradise High School, meets his fellow Garde, Marina (Seven), who is stuck in a
religious convent in Spain. In the book, John and Marina both have the same
mission, which is to find their Chests and find the remaining Garde. They face many
challenges, but with the help of their friends and Cepans, they push through and
defeat them. The characters mature tremendously throughout the book. John and
Marina both overcome their fears and become stronger and tougher as they master
challenges they must overcome.
This book was amazing. The plot is great, and I didn’t ever want to put it down while I
was reading it. I felt really “in touch” with the characters, and I felt I was feeling the
emotions they felt in the book. There was a ton of action, and I really liked the
touching and sad moments where the characters mourned over a friend who fell in
battle. There were also plot twists where I was very stunned. This book was truly one
of the best I’ve read in the past few months.
I didn’t have any problems at all with this book. It was fun, touching, and basically
flat-out amazing. I give this book a full 5 out of 5 stars, and I would definitely
recommend it to others."

gives you the full story on Nine and gives you an explanation of why he acts that way.
This book tells you everything that happened to Nine, starting from living in a
penthouse to getting betrayed by the one girl he really loved.
This was definitely an amazing book and one that I wanted to read. Even though
Nine was self-centered and a jerk in the Lorien Legacies, he was my favorite
character as he was unique compared to the other characters, and I was happy to
have this backstory about him. The book itself was also very good, as it drew me in
as I read it. It had a ton of action, and the emotional parts were really good. I really
felt like I was feeling what Nine was feeling.
This book was amazing, just like all the other Lorien Legacies books. It really helped
me understand more about Nine, and why he acted in that way in the other books.
Overall, this book is one of the best I’ve read in a long time. I would definitely

nice twist to the usual Lorien Legacies Series. Unlike the original, this book focuses
on the Human Garde, who were given powers by the Loric Entity in the epic battle
between the Loric and the Mogs.
The story focuses on six Human Garde (Nigel, Caleb, Ran, Isabela, Kopano, Taylor)
and starts with their reactions to their newfound powers. Some try to hide them while
others are proud, but they are a little shocked at this development. Their families are
also very shocked, and they react in very different ways. Some parents are scared,
some are proud, and some try to use them for their good. Some try to keep living
their everyday lives, but due to the law, all of them are sent to the Human Garde
Academy and are put under the care of Professor Nine.
Now, if you think this is all, you are wrong. In the first half of the story, it is focused on
the lives of the Human Garde and their lives at the Academy. But in the last half of
the book, a new character, named Einar, is introduced. Unlike the others, he isn’t
enrolled in the Academy. Instead, he joined a shady association called the
Foundation and tried to get the other Garde to join him.
This book was a great sequel to the I am Number Four Series. I really liked that it
brought in new characters to the series, and I loved the excellent character
development. The characters change a lot throughout the book, and it is enjoyable to
watch. It is also great that you can see all of the characters’ points of view, which
helps you to understand the book better.
I have read all the Lorien Legacies books, but this one, in my opinion, tops them all. It
was just a great book, and I couldn’t put it down until I was done. I give this a full 5
out of 5 stars and would definitely recommend this book to others."

5/19/2020 21:21:14,10,,Five’s Betrayal,,Pittacus Lore,"8,9",,5,,,"If you ever read the Lorien Legacies series, then you would know Number Five as the
traitor, the turncoat. This book, the 9th addition to the “Lost Files” series, tells us
about the time that he spent among the Mogs.
If you read Five’s Legacy, the 7th book in the series, you would know that Five, after
losing his Cepan, was taken into the care of Ethan, who was secretly working with
the Mogs. After a little while, Five also joined the Mogs and became loyal to them.
Now he is looking for the other Garde to also join the Mogadorian Cause.
The book starts off with Five talking to himself about how he will rule over North
America with the Mogs and how he is on the right side. It is pretty obvious to see that
Five was seriously brainwashed. After this little session of Five talking to himself, the
book goes to Five’s daily life with the Mogs. He is still good friends with Ethan and
talks to him regularly, but the Mogs are the ones who are really telling him what to do.
He follows their orders, does exactly what they tell him to do, and always looks for
ways to please Setrakus Ra. Eventually, that crooked motivation gets him to kill one
of his closest friends...
I was really hyped to hear that this book came out. Yes, Five is my least favorite
character, but I did want to know what happened while Five was working with the
Mogadorians. And let me tell you, I was not disappointed. Almost every part of this
book was good. The writing style of this book was descriptive and had a lot of
dialogue, with no excessively long paragraphs. I also really liked the characters, as
they felt so real and lifelike. It really felt like they were right in front of me.
This book was a fun read and had tons of action to go with it. Sure, it’s not going to
be the best or longest book on your reading list, but it will keep you entertained while
you read it and you won’t be able to put it down. I personally really liked the book and
would recommend it for a short and fun read."

5/22/2020 9:27:00,10,,The Fate of Ten,,Pittacus Lore,"8,9",,4,,,"The Fate of Ten is the second to last book of the “Lorien Legacies”, and it continues
the series with a surprising twist.
The story starts off with a normal 15 year old girl and her stepfather watching the
news about the Mog’s attack. As she is watching, she hears sounds outside the door.
Soon after, Mogadorian soldiers rush in and the stepfather sacrifices himself to save
her. Since the Mogs are much more athletically able than her, she is soon cornered
by three of them. It seems like the end, and as she raises her arms in a feeble
attempt to save herself, the three Mogs are sent flying backwards by her telekinesis.
With her newfound power, she joins the Garde in the fight.
While the fight in New York goes on, Six, Marina, Sarah, and Adam are in the Loric
Sanctuary, when suddenly Ella telepathically reaches out to them and tells them to
run. Thinking that Setrakus Ra was coming to take the Sanctuary, they decide to
stay, and soon enough, the Anubis, Setrakus Ra’s battleship, comes into view. As
they prepare to fight, they realize something very bad. Setrakus was coming to
destroy the Sanctuary, not take it. Soon, they are fighting for their lives. As the battle
goes on, it looks like Setrakus Ra will beat them. He badly injured Sarah and
pummeled Marina to the floor. But with the last of her strength, Six stabs the Mog in
the heart. He seems like he is dying, but as Six tries to finish him off, Phiri Dun-Ra
emerges from the forest and whisks him off with the Anubis.
I really liked this book. It had a lot of action and I didn’t want to put it down at all. It
had a nice twist, which was that humans had Legacies now. I also really liked the
characters, as they felt so real, and I felt the emotions they were feeling. The only
thing I didn’t like about this book was that it was kind of the same thing over and over.
It’s not that bad, but still, it felt like Iwas reading the same thing over and over again.
Overall, this was a really good book, and I really enjoyed it. Yes, some plot elements
were a little repetitive, but it was still a really good book and I would recommend it to
others."

From the beginning of his life, Otto knew that he was special. By that, he means that he is much more intellectually advanced than other kids. Unfortunately, Otto decides to use that intelligence to prank the Prime Minister of Europe during his biggest speech of his career. As he is celebrating, he sees a dark figure behind him in his room. The figure shoots him with something and he loses consciousness.
After that, he finds himself on a helicopter with another boy named Wing. They hit it off well, and they became good friends.When they arrived and were given a tour of the school of villainy, they were sent off to their classes. But instead of learning things like math or science, they learn about stealth and code-breaking! During their   classes, they meet two girls, Shelby and Laura, and the group of four becomes inseparable.
As they go on with their lives at H.I.V.E., they find themselves wanting to escape more and more from the school. Eventually, Otto thinks up a plan and they choose a date to escape together.
When I read this book, I was left wishing that I could read more. This book has a great storyline that never ceased to keep me on my toes. It had a load of action, and had a bit of humor as well. The character development was fantastic, and they felt very real. The book really drew me in and didn’t let go.
Overall, this book was no doubt a 5/5. I really loved this book, and you can imagine how stoked I was when the next book came out. It honestly was one of the best books I’ve read in a long time, and I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to have an exciting and fun read."

6/5/2020 0:20:34,9,,Of Mice and Men,,John Steinbeck,9,,4,,,"Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck is a classic American novella telling the tale of two Great Depression era migrant workers in California. George Milton, a relatively mundane character struggling to get by is accompanied by Lennie Small, a mentally challenged man with an inescapable fascination with stroking soft objects. The plot begins as the two drifters head to a large, industrial farm where they expect to find work as manual laborers. They were forced from their previous work at a similar ranch because of a fiasco triggered by George’s fixation with a girl’s soft dress and his confusion when told not to touch the girl.
A primary theme throughout the book is the high minded ambitions and fantasies of the characters. Lennie and George, for one, often think of their “farm dream”, where the two own their own plot of land and live off the land together in comfort.
Eventually the pair arrive at their new farm and meet the various other workers, including Slim, a thoughtful and respected leader, Candy, an ageing man with an elderly dog companion, and Crooks, an African-American stable-hand who is forced to sleep in a small room in the barn, away from the others due to his race. Other characters include Curley, the son of the farm’s owner and boss, who is wed to a young girl referred to only as “Curley’s wife”.
This young girl embodies many of the book’s themes, including discrimination, hardship, and misfortune. She is just one of many characters treated like a subhuman being. Crooks, Lennie, and Candy all also face fear, discrimination, or harrassment because of some factor out of their control."
6/5/2020 21:54:52,9,,In Some Other Life,,Jessica Brody,"7,8,9",,4,,,"The tragic novella is packed with rich descriptions of settings and characters, creating an immersive reading experience. The ever-present themes of struggle and inequity are valuable to comfortable modern readers as a reminder of what can happen when strained humans are allowed to judge one another and dreams seem simply impossible.
In Some Other Life by Jessica Brody is about a driven high schooler, Kennedy Rhodes, whose world is crumbling beneath her feet. She begins to wonder if the life changing decision she made three years ago wasn't worth it. Then, right after she walks in on her boyfriend kissing her best friend, she's transported into an alternate reality where she is living her dream life. But as soon as she begins to accept this reality, she begins to uncover alternate Kennedy's dark secrets, showing she isn't as perfect as she seems. This YA novel merges two classic plots, an alternate reality swap and a life changing decision, to create a fresh new take. The novel illustrates the phrase ""Everything happens for a reason"" perfectly, by using Kennedy's dream life as an example that although everything doesn't seem to be going as planned, everything turns out all right in the end. The growth of Kennedy throughout the book, from trying to control the uncontrollable to understanding that life is unpredictable, is one of the best things about the novel. Her relationship with a certain character is dynamic and very entertaining to read, and I like how he transcends both of her realities, showing that some things are meant to be. Another added part of the book  is that the chapters occurring in Kennedy's original reality start with ""If..."", while in the alternate reality they start with ""Then..."", mimicking the difference between the realities. Overall, although the book has some flaws, it is a great read and something I couldn't put down. I would definitely recommend it."
6/5/2020 23:12:49,9,,Night,,Elie Wiesel,9,,5,,,"Elie Wiesel’s Night is a must-read memoir chronicling in great detail the author’s experience as a victim of the Holocaust. The short book begins at a status quo, with the young Wiesel living a relatively normal life as a Jew growing up in a small town in Romania. Soon his life begins to fall apart as Nazi Germany usurps control of the region and begins to execute its plans upon the local Jewish people.
Soon all that the boy has taken for granted is taken from him and the horrors of life under the thumb of a hostile nation set in. His family is sent to Auschwitz, the largest of the concentration camps, where they are quickly separated, never to be fully reunited. The boy and his father struggle together through pestilence, starvation, manual labor, and constant exposure to death.
Wiesel thoughtfully recalls the truly gruesome war crimes and brutal atrocities committed on his people and himself expertly. This book is one of the few sources that combine intense first-person experience in the Holocaust with beautiful writing. Its pungency makes it especially relevant for young people who have likely never interacted with a survivor in any authentic way. In a world that has already lost nearly all witnesses of what is perhaps the best example of true human evil, carefully, artfully written works like Night provide a necessary door into the past."
6/6/2020 0:16:51,9,,The Secret Language of Sisters,,Luanne Rice,"8,9",,5,,,"The Secret Language of Sisters is a book that struck me in a way not many have. It starts off with a bang, when one of the protagonists, the responsible Roo, gets into a car accident as a result from checking a text message her sister Tilly sent, trapping her mind in her body. From there on, it is an uphill battle for both Roo and Tilly. This book entwines both girls' perspectives into a compelling story of loss, discovery and understanding each other. This book teaches the ethics behind texting and driving,  as well as how quickly someone's life can change in a split second. The bond between Roo and Tilly is very inspiring. Even to someone who has not experienced a tragic accident, the bond between them relates to everyone who has an especially strong bond to someone, whether familial or not.
One part of the book that made it more realistic and therefore more brilliant, is how Roo and Tilly began to drift apart after the accident. One would think that something like this would draw them closer. I thought this was a really good addition on part of the Mrs. Rice, the author. Instead of painting an ideal recovery, she gives insight on how even betrayal can be made even within sisters, and how their bond overcomes this.
The story behind Tilly and her immense guilt at sending an irresponsible text message and going behind Roo's back while she is in the hospital is the most moving part of the book. I think that it's one of the most well written parts. Her growth throughout the book is almost beautiful.
I really liked how the author created a sense of suspense throughout the entire story. Even in the moments that it seemed to be calm, there was always an air of tension in everything Luanne Rice wrote, until the very end. I think this is why I was unable to put the book down.
I highly recommend this book, it made me want to cry, laugh and moved me in general."
6/6/2020 23:47:16,9,,Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,,Mark Twain,8,,4,,,"Mark Twain’s Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a classic American coming-of-age novel set on a raft floating down the Mississippi River in the mid-1800s.
Huckleberry Finn, a boy who first appeared in the book’s prequel The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, is the son of an alcoholic who raises him in poverty and crime until he is adopted by a charitable widow. Soon, however, Huck finds himself escaping his hometown after his father attempts to repossess the boy. He stumbles upon the widow’s escaped slave Jim and, after briefly pondering the ethics of living with a black man, the two set off together. Their follies include befriending other vagabonds who claim to be heirs of European thrones, scamming towns along the riverside out of money in creative ways, and accidentally igniting an ancient family feud that soon escalates into an all-out gun battle.
Some versions of the book include sketch-style images that were featured in the original publications of the book. Twain claimed the novel was written in seven different American English dialects, but to most modern readers the book just seems to be written in an old-timey sounding style. Readers should beware that archaic and offensive racial language is used liberally.
Many literary experts believe the wild plot of his story laid the groundwork for much of the American fiction writing to come. Its themes include the ethics of racism
— mainly through Huckleberry’s struggle to justify his archaic views while living with and befriending a black man. For a historical read that celebrates the joys of youth and freedom, read Adventures of Huckleberry Finn."
6/7/2020 10:33:22,10,,The Overlord Protocol,,Mark Walden,"8,9",,5,,,"The Overlord Protocol is the second book of the H.I.V.E. book series, and it does a good job in continuing it.
The book starts off with a meeting between the G.L.O.V.E. ruling council. It focuses on Nero, and his thoughts on how he doesn’t trust the new villain called Cypher. As Nero walks out after the meeting is over, he is ambushed by a few men asking for the amulet he carries with him. Luckily, Raven comes in and disposes of them. Nero suspects that they were Cypher’s men.
After that event, there isn’t much of an incident until one day, Wing is called into Nero’s office. Nero then tells him that Wing’s father was killed in an accident. He is allowed to go with one other student to his funeral, and he chooses Otto. He, Otto, and Raven prepare for the long trip ahead of them. When they are in Japan, they are unexpectedly attacked by Cypher. As they are fighting him, Cypher suddenly takes out a gun and shoots Wing. They take his body on his helicopter and leave. This marks the start of a war between Cypher and H.I.V.E….
This was a really good book. It had a lot of surprises, and a lot of action. The characters felt very real, and it felt like they were right there in front of me. It was also great that it gave you a detailed description of the situation. That really helped to make the story feel more realistic. But perhaps my favorite part of all was that we got to know all the characters’ point of views. This gave the story more depth and made the whole storyline much easier to understand.
This book has everything; friendship, action, suspense, and it was just a really fun book to read. The book really drew me in, and I couldn’t put it down. Overall, this book is a must-read for people who like action-packed books, and I would definitely recommend this book to other people."

6/7/2020 20:06:45,9,,Silent Spring,,Rachel Carson,11,,4,,,"Rachel Carson’s environmentalist classic Silent Spring is an influential 60s-era nonfiction book detailing the increasingly precarious status of the natural world. It’s wide-spread success sparked the environmental movement of the late 20th century and led to the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency along with the widespread banning of the dangerous pesticide DDT.
The first chapter, entitled “A Fable for Tomorrow”, is a description of a dystopian American town, where fish and birds no longer live and rampant health issues from intense pesticide use plague the people, along with other troubling situations. Carson then uses the next 16 chapters of the book to give a scientific and passionate explanation for each effect. The main ideas explored include pesticide use’s effect on America’s ecology, as well as the negative effects on human health that man’s  actions on the environment can have.
Readers should be aware that the book is dense and fact-based, it takes time and patience to read but offers tons of great knowledge. While some aspects of the information are slightly dated, and climate change, (yet to be discovered at the time of writing), is not discussed, the book’s massive historical significance is reason enough to read it.
For readers trying to take their understanding of concepts like bioaccumulation and resistance to insecticides in malaria-carrying mosquitoes, Silent Spring is worth a read."
6/7/2020 23:30:19,9,,The Odyssey: A Graphic Novel,,Gareth Hinds,7,,4,,,"The Odyssey: A Graphic Novel by Gareth Hinds is an approachable, engaging, and relatively quick version of Homer’s classic epic of the same name. This rendition features remarkable artwork covering every page and a simplified storyline compressed to fit into speech bubbles while remaining remarkably true to the original story.
The plot, which has been translated and adapted hundreds of ways, centers on a lost king of the ancient Greek island of Ithaca. On his way home from the distant Trojan War, Odysseus finds his boat off course and separated from its companions. The king and his crew experience various fantastical trials and tribulations, interacting with gods and cyclops and even journeying to the underworld as they attempt to make it back to Ithaca. Meanwhile, back home, the king’s twenty-something-year-old son Telemachus is beginning to think he may have to usurp his father’s throne should he never return. But this isn’t a simple task, since a group of one hundred rowdy suitors have moved into the palace and are attempting to court the queen and take the throne for themselves.
Frequently taught in school English classes, the story is an excellent thing to be familiar with. This graphic adaptation makes the plot more engaging and digestible, and thus, can be read alongside a literary version to aid in understanding the tale."
6/9/2020 9:22:45,10,,Speak,,Laurie Halse-Anderson,"9,10,11,12",,4,,,"Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson is a break taking, coming of age novel, where one teen is forced to lose her innocence before high school even starts. The whole plot is seen through Melinda’s both insecure and scared eyes, mainly in the halls of Merryweather High School in Syracuse.  In her mind, she dreads utilizing her voice and sharing exactly what occurred at the August, upperclassmen’s party just days before school started. People perceive Melinda to be a snitch, as she called the police on the party. Readers are exposed to the consequences Melinda now has to deal with because of her actions, as she loses those whom she presumed had her back, and her grades plummet as well because she begins to not care about large aspects of her life anymore.  Her emotions are simply getting the best of her and consuming her life entirely.  While reading, circumstances of peer pressure in my  own life came into my mind, and I was able to feel Melinda’s exact emotions, which is a reflection of Halse-Anderson’s engrossing style of writing. Within the first couple of pages, readers are immediately exposed to the isolation Melinda is dealing with as a consequence of calling the cops on the party, which leaves an emotional affect, as readers begin to feel sympathy toward her. It is clear if Melinda does want to speak up about the events that unfolded at the party, she is going to have a very difficult time, considering she is alone with no help or moral support and many have hatred toward her. Readers are able to feel a sense of being trapped and confined through Anderson’s descriptions, which puts readers in Melinda’s helpless perspective.  This adds an interesting, dramatic spin as the plot continues. Laurie Halse Andersons’s writing is both captivating and inspiring, and a true page turner at that.  Readers simply just can’t stop reading because they want to know the reason Melinda's world turned upside down. Readers are easily hooked and never want to put the novel down, since Anderson waits until the end to reveal the situation that transpired.
Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson is a novel everyone should read, as it shares valuable life lessons, and a very imperative message: speak up."
6/15/2020 10:32:04,10,,The Julian Chapter,,R.J. Palacio,"8,9",,5,,,"If you ever read Wonder in your life, then you would know that it is about a boy named August, who looks very different from other children due to his multiple surgeries. You would also know that there is a boy named Julian, who bullies him the most. This book focuses on Julian’s point of view and gives some explanation as to why he acted that way.
Julian first meets Auggie when he is introducing him to Beecher Prep. He is rude to him during the tour and is shocked by his appearance. After this, he is constantly mean to Auggie and puts dirty notes in his locker. Things go on like this until everything suddenly blows up in Julian’s face. The notes he wrote to Auggie are found by Mr. Tushman, and he is suspended for two weeks. Because of this, his parents are extremely angered at the school and decide that Julian will leave Beecher Prep after the school year.
When he comes back from the suspension, he is shocked because suddenly, everyone is extremely nice to Auggie while he is being iced out. He is treated like a jerk, and he becomes the outcast that he tried to make Auggie become.
During summer break, he visits his grandmother. After she hears about what happened in his school, she starts to tell him a story about her childhood that involves a child with a similar condition as Auggie. After the story, Julian suddenly feels extreme remorse for what he did. He writes an apology letter to Auggie, and Auggie generously accepts.
This book was really amazing. It had such great character development and really brings out your emotions. It has a great lesson that you can learn from it, and you can really see the characters in front of you. I really liked that this book gave us Julian’s perspective, as now I feel that I understand the original book better. I also really liked that the characters changed so much during the course of the book. That helped to give the book more depth and meaning.
This book was no doubt a 5/5. It was no doubt one of the best books I’ve read in my entire life as it had emotion, meaning, and a lesson all packed into one book. This was an amazing book, and I will definitely recommend this to everyone."

6/15/2020 10:33:14,10,,Pluto,,R.J. Palacio,"8,9",,4,,,"Before Auggie came to Beecher Prep, his best friend was a boy named Christopher. This book gives us his point of view.
Chris and Auggie first met when they were babies. Their moms were best friends, so they were introduced to each other when they were newborns. As Chris was around Auggie through all his surgeries, he is fine with Auggie’s appearance. They play games together and pretend that they are on Pluto, hence the title of the book. But as he grows up and sees what other people’s reaction to Auggie is, he realizes that Auggie isn’t a normal kid.
Now as Auggie moves on and goes to Beecher Prep, the two of them become more and more distant. Christopher realizes that being Auggie’s friend is not easy, as his other friends are freaked out by his appearance. As a result of that, they become more distant and become farther from each other. Life goes on normally after that, but as a lot of complicated things like divorce and injuries happen in his life, he realizes that “Good friendships are worth a little extra effort.”
This book was good, but not great. It was great that it had a good lesson to be learned, and that it was a sweet and meaningful book. It was emotional, and the characters were quite lovable. Despite that though, I felt that the other books like The Julian Chapter and Shingaling were more necessary and more relevant to the original book, Wonder. I liked Chris as a character, but that was all. I felt like he wasn’t that important to the whole Wonder storyline.
This book was pretty good, and although it had a few drawbacks, it was overall a well-written and touching book. I rate this a 4/5, and I would recommend this to people who want a short and touching read."

6/21/2020 16:52:07,11,,Battle Cry of Freedom,,James M. McPherson,"9,10,11,12",,5,,,"The book I reviewed was Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era by James M. McPherson which covers the entire history of the Civil War. The book won the Pulitzer Prize and is a very well acclaimed title. The book covers the entirety of the war, the Antebellum era preceding it with events such as the Mexican American War and slavery all the way to Lincoln’s eventual assassination. Essentially, if you can only read one book on all of the Civil War, this is the book that fills that need. As  such, the book does not cover just focus on one aspect or issue of the war, but manages to cover nearly every feature of the war that one could think of. McPherson covers not just the war itself and it’s campaigns, but the social and economic life of the home fronts, foreign policy, politics, culture and more. The book was great for me as I was writing a research paper on a specific topic, yet the book still held a vast amount of information on my subject, which happened to be the Confederate economy and the home front. The book provided not only new conclusions to draw from, but plenty of primary sources and other details to the point where it became one of my most referred sources.
In the end, this title is one I wholly recommend. While the size of the book is certainly daunting, the language used in the book was never tedious and terribly difficult to understand for a younger audience. Compared to other long historical books I’ve tried to read, this one always kept you interested and was always easy to understand.  All in all, this book is one anyone interested in history or the Civil War should read, it can be considered the all purpose book on the war."

6/21/2020 17:37:54,11,,Why The North Won The Civil War,,David Herbert Donald,"8,9,10,11,12",,4,,,"The book I reviewed was Why The North The Civil War by David Herbert Donald and several other authors. The book contains a series of essays by various authors with varying inputs on what each believes to be the biggest factor in the South’s defeat in the Civil War. The book manages to provide comparisons of how military, political and social factors each contributed to the Union’s victory, almost turning the book into a lecture or discussion on the war that is right there for you to reference to. The author viewpoints range from how military leadership, economic imbalances, foreign policy, political leadership all shaped the war.
The book itself is very concise and easy to understand. It is very straight to the point and unlike a lot of other history books which can be very long, this one is much shorter and divided up into chapters easily referenced to. The arguments given by each of the authors are all straight forward as well, with each author arguing for a specific point of view on the war. All in all, this book is one that I would recommend for anyone just starting to get interested in the Civil War or history, as while the title is relatively short, it still packs a lot of great information easily understandable."

6/25/2020 21:07:22,9,,Kalahari,,Jessica Khoury,"8,9,10",,5,,,"When a group of teenagers come to the Kalahari desert for a conservation research program, resident Sarah Carmichael is dreading the social interaction that comes  with babysitting a rich couple, a know-it-all, a clown, and the nice guy. But after Sarah’s father suddenly goes off to chase some poachers, the babysitting is looking to be much more permanent. Sarah is left stranded in the vast desert with hardly any resources, a fear of losing her dad, and five clueless teenagers. If this wasn’t bad enough, they come face-to-face with a silver lion that absorbs bullets and is seemingly made out of mercury. As the stories of Sarah’s mother’s death and the silver lion start to entwine, the group of six realize that the Kalahari hides much more secrets that they would have ever thought.
I thought that “Kalahari: by Jessica Khoury was a stunning novel. The plot has the perfect amount of escalation and I love how minor plot points like the death of Sarah’ s mother start slowly becoming part of the main story. The story seemingly starts out like a survival story, but it quickly becomes sci-fi when they start discovering animals infected with a silver virus, just like the lion. Besides the plot, the characters are also well written. They seem to be very stereotyped in the beginning, but as they get more and more scared for their lives, they become much more 3-dimensional. They slowly expose their hidden problems to each other, as if they wanted to tell someone just in case they didn’t survive. It’s almost telling the reader that you shouldn’t immediately stereotype people right away, especially if your first impression was when they were feeling uncomfortable. The whole story is about layers. Nothing is made up of one surface. There is always something underneath."
6/30/2020 11:53:22,9,,Good Dog,,Dan Gemeinhart,"6,7,8",,5,,,"Brodie has died, and woken up in the world of the dead where they can run all day and live worry free. Who would want to leave such a perfect world? To Brodie everything isn't perfect, he keeps having a vague memory of a monster and his boy, who is in trouble. He doesn't know anything else except that he needs to go back and save his boy. Bodie knows the risks but he bends the rules and returns back anyway. Travelling as a soul into the land of the living is dangerous but Brodie will risk anything to protect his boy.
This book mainly follows three characters, Brodie, Tuck, and Patsy. Brodie is a loving dog who is willing to risk everything, even his life to save the people that he loves. Tuck is a care-free dog who enjoys nothing more than running, but he isn't  quite ready to move forward as he still feels he has unfinished business. He might not be the brightest dog, but his compassion and empathy for others sure make up for it. Patsy is a sassy cat who doesn't feel attached to anyone, after a long life of abandonment. As her soul is slowly fading away she figures she has nothing better to do then to follow Brodie and Tuck on their adventure.
The book is an empowering story demonstrating just how far some are willing to go for love. You follow Brody, Tuck, and Patsy’s unique personalities and touching stories as they all navigate as lost souls through the living world they no longer belong to. Throughout this book these characters grow on you and you will soon find yourself crying both happy and sad tears. I give this book five stars as it emotionally reached out to me and placed me in the shoes of the best dog I’ve ever seen. I would absolutely recommend this book to anybody looking for a heartfelt story that is almost impossible to place down, even for just a minute."

Alexander includes a variety of different poems, and they are all written very well. Alexander also includes ""Basketball Rules"" that also can apply to life. The Crossover is told by 12-year-old Josh Bell, everything that happened in his 7th-grade year of Reggie Lewis Middle School. He experiences the meaning of family, forgiveness, and loss. His family is pretty close, with Jordon “JB” Bell as his brother, his dad, and his mom. Even though Josh and JB are twins, they couldn't be more different. Throughout the book, his relationship with his brother has some bumps in the road, but they realize that they are closer than they thought and become closer than ever in the end. Josh is very close to his dad, a retired basketball player. In the end, Josh realizes that even when times feel rough, you can always pick yourself up again. A quote from the book The Crossover, ""A loss is inevitable, like snow in winter. True champions learn to dance through the storm.”  The Crossover was a great book and I would recommend this to middle school students and adults. It left a powerful message after I read it and will probably do the same with anyone else that reads it."

Scout Finch lives in Maycomb, a small town in Alabama. She lives with her brother Jem and her father Atticus. Everyone in Maycomb knows each other, and everyone has their own social standing. Atticus is a lawyer, and he’s appointed to defend a black man who’s been accused of committing a terrible crime. This doesn’t make life any easier for Jem and Scout as they are constantly defending their father’s good name. This story views prejudice and growing up through the eyes of young Scout as she navigates through life.
This book is an absolute must read! It explores important topics and concepts such as prejudice and racism, but it shows them through the eyes of a young empathetic girl. It shows her views on her father, her community, and the unfairness of it all. She shows readers what it’s like to grow up, and adapt to the ever changing world around us.
I gave this book a 4 out of 5 stars as I felt it was a classic and a really good read that demonstrated important morals and values. It was sometimes a little bit  slow, and some phrases/words were a little confusing to understand at first. Overall though it had a strong plot and you truly got attached to the characters and their heart wrenching story."

She one day finds that they have disappeared and been mailed out. The issue is that one of the love letters is addressed to her sister's boyfriend, Josh Sanderson. To deal with this, Lara Jean teams up with Peter Kavinsky, another letter recipient, to convince Josh that she no longer has feelings for him by involving herself in a fake relationship with Peter. However, as this fake relationship continues, both Peter and Lara Jean start to develop genuine feelings for each other and the book follows Lara Jean as she learns to navigate through the very complicated situation that has been created.
Jenny Han delivers a witty, romantic, and enchanting story, offering a fresh take on traditional high school romance novels. The main character, Lara Jean, is an intelligent heroine that develops throughout the novel while in her ""fake"" romance with Peter. One aspect of this book that readers will enjoy is how realistic the problems are. Lara Jean is faced with social, romantic, and family issues that are easy to relate and connect to, making this a very enjoyable read for practically any age."

One, being the highest caste is only for royalty, like Prince Maxon. All the way down to an Eight, the lowest caste. America Singer, a hardworking Five, who is trying to provide for her family hears about an event called the Selection. The Selection is a process in which the Prince has 35 girls come to the palace and he chooses one to be his wife. Although she is hesitant to apply to participate in the selection, she does because if she did win her family could be Ones. But due to her conceptions about Prince Maxon being shallow, and her longtime boyfriend, Aspen at home who she always believed she would marry, she doesn’t think she will get anything except the paycheck that will got to her family for her participation in the selection.
This consuming romance novel, one will fall in love with the characters and their imperfect personalities. Cass’s page-turning writing will keep one from putting down this book.
I absolutely loved this novel and definitely would recommend it to anyone who likes dystopian settings and romance. The love triangles and relationships were intriguing to read about. I am astonished by Cass’s creativity in the dystopian world she creates."

In the epistolary novel, The Perks of Being a Wallflower written by Stephen Chbosky, Charlie learns about life, love, friendship, and mental health as he tackles his high school career. This coming-of-age novel compels readers with its fast past yet detailed and thoroughly written letters that read like one was watching the context of the note unfold themselves.
The wide range of light to deep character in this book keeps the relationships between Charlie and each of his unique classmates refreshing and realistic.
I believe that this is a book every teen should read. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone- even if realistic fiction isn’t your favorite genre. This novel brings awareness to issues that can happen in one’s mind when it seems as if they are perfectly fine on the outside."

But now that Theo is gone for good, it feels as if life isn’t just wrong, but has no point at all anymore. Jealousy, sadness, anger, denial, guilt, and grief have taken over Griffin’s already OCD filled mind since his ex-boyfriend, Theo died.
As Griffin begins to cope with Theo’s death, he has to turn to people for help that he never thought he would. Griffin must find who he is without Theo and but still be able to cherish the not nearly long enough time he had with him.
In History is All You Left Me by Adam Silvera, mental illness, stages of grief, and love stories that were destined for failure are not just addressed but put into action and portrayed how real and painful these situations are.
This book will make one cry, think, and then cry again. I recommend this novel to anyone who likes a book that will make them consider themselves and their own life. Griffin’s stages of grief are so real and well-written the reader will feel his pain like their own."

Jennifer Lynn Barnes delivers the first of The Naturals series which will undoubtedly keep young readers at the edge of their seats. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a fun, fast-paced read. The characters are relatable, and it is entertaining to watch dynamics between them while also discovering more about their individual stories  and enjoying an intriguing and unpredictable plot.

Thinking she’s all out of options, she turns to the last thing she would have thought about doing, running for prom queen. Winning prom queen is the only way she will be able to attend Pennington, her dream school.
The main characters in this book are Liz Lightly, a quiet and anxious girl. Mack, the new girl who is out there in every way possible especially when it comes to her Pride. Gabi, Liz’s best friend who is obsessed with fashion and is a true friend. She does everything physically possible so that Liz can win prom queen.
The author definitely did a good job of making the characters in this book realistic, she made them complicated people with emotions who I feel the reader can find a connection to. This book truly focuses on some important concepts like the LGBTQ+ community and how even today people frown upon them. This story is uplifting and it shows how anybody can rise from the shadows and into the spotlight. I would definitely recommend this book to anybody looking for a fight hard, romantic book."
